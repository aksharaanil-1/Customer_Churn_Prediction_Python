# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

 ###This project was done in my VIRTUAL internship @Saiket Technologies Limited,Noida,India.

####Purpose:
This project aims to help businesses proactively identify customers who are likely to stop using their services.

###The dashboard and model can be used by:
- Customer retention teams to launch targeted interventions
- Product and service teams to understand churn behavior
- Data analysts/scientists for churn risk profiling

### Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major challenge in subscription-based and service-driven industries. Losing customers can significantly impact revenue and growth. Without predictive insights, businesses struggle to retain users effectively.

This project addresses the need for a data-driven solution to predict churn, enabling timely and focused retention strategies.

Features and Highlights Business Problem Addressed:
Identifying high-risk churn customers before they leave enabling data-backed customer success and retention strategies

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals:
Build a classification model to predict if a customer will churn

Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends in churn behavior

Use feature importance and correlation analysis to explain model decisions

ðŸ“ˆ Visuals and Walkthrough:
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Distribution of churn vs. non-churn customers

Key churn indicators (e.g., contract type, tenure, customer service calls)

Correlation heatmap of numerical features

Model Building:

Preprocessing steps: label encoding, scaling, handling missing values

Algorithms used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

Model Evaluation:

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

ROC Curve

Feature importance bar chart

Actionable Insights:

Customers with month-to-month contracts and multiple service complaints are more likely to churn

Tenure and support satisfaction are strong retention indicators
